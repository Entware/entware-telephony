    asterisk: remove app-voicemail-imap module
    
    Removed app-voicemail-imap from the Asterisk modules.
    
    The module depends on uw-imap, which has been removed from OpenWrt packages feed as it is unmaintained and no longer available.
    
    There is currently no alternative IMAP implementation in OpenWrt that this module could depend on, so the module is removed.
